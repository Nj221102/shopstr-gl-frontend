# Shopstr Username Registration

A simple web application for registering Bitcoin usernames with BOLT12 offers.

## Getting Started

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

### Production Build

```bash
# Create a production build (static export)
npm run build

# Serve the static files
npm start
```

The application is configured for static export with Next.js, which means it generates HTML/CSS/JS files that can be served from any static file server, including GitHub Pages.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

This project is configured for GitHub Pages deployment. When you push to the main branch, it will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages.

### Custom Server

If you want to serve the application from a custom server:

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Copy the contents of the `out` directory to your server
3. Configure your server to serve static files from this directory

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
